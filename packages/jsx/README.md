# JSX

```bash
npm install --save @ribajs/jsx
```

Experimental JSX support. The JSX module was created to be able to create Typedoc themes with Riba, therefore the implementation is very [similar to Typedoc`s JSX implementation](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/blob/master/src/lib/utils/jsx.ts). So at this point many credits and acknowledgements goes to Typedoc.
