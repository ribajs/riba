To get started, you can either scaffold the project with the Riba CLI.

To scaffold the project with the Riba CLI, run the following commands. This will create a new project directory, and populate the directory with the initial core Riba files and supporting modules, creating a conventional base structure for your project. Creating a new project with the Riba CLI is recommended for first-time users.

```bash
npm i -g @ribajs/cli
riba new project-name
```

This will create the `project-name` directory, node modules and a few other boilerplate files will be installed, and a src/ directory will be created and populated with several core files.
